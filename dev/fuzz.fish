# Workaround to fuzz all the fuzz tests we can write, roughly stolen from https://github.com/golang/go/issues/46312#issuecomment-1153345129
# Additionally, the use of ag to match a single part of the function was informed by https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/issues/400#issuecomment-418454903
